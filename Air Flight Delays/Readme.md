# International Det Statistics Analysis

## Details
It's not that we humans only take debts to manage our necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable 
lives. The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries.
We are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount 
of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories.

## Dataset
The dataset belongs to the World Bank and contains information 
about how much money countries worldwide owing to the Bank. 
It includes the following columns:
        • Country_name: Full name of the country
        • Country_code: Three-letter code for the country.
        • Indicator_name: It specifies the motive behind the debt.
        • indicator_code: Some-letter code for the indicator.
        • debt: The Amount of Dept.

## Project Idea
We are going to find the answers to questions like:
        1. What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
        2. Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
        3. What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
        4. Find the number of distinct countries in your dataset.
        5. Find the distinct debt indicators.
        6. Totaling the amount of debt owed by the countries.
        7. Find country with the highest debt.
        8. Average amount of debt across indicators.
