# Olympic History Data analysis
## Details
The modern Olympic Games were from the beginning part of 
world culture and modern history, reflecting political tensions, economic crises, cultural flowering, and technological development.
From the very first edition athletics events had a privileged place in the Olympic program. Much have changed since 1896, not only in number of events, athletes, competition and prizes, but in philosophy, sport sciences, ethics and professional approach as well.
In this project we will work with a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to 2016

1. Athlete_Events.

## Project Idea
First you should join the 2 tables together to make your analysis 
simpler, then you need to analyze your dataset based on these 
blocks:
• Olympic History General Information:
    1. What is the beginning and ending years?
    2. How many Olympics have been held in 120 years?
    3. What are total number of medals by season?
• Gender In Olympic Games:
    1. What is gender ratio over seasons?
    2. What is gender number over medal?
• Region Analyze:
    1. Which country has the most athletes?
    2. What is the medal count by country?
• Athlete Performance:
    1. Who has participated in the most Olympic Games?
    2. Who are top athletes by medal?
