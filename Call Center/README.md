# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL

#### Overview:
In this project, I conducted thorough data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset sourced from a Call Center using SQL.

### Methodology:
Utilizing SQL on SSMS, I meticulously performed the following tasks:

#### Data Preprocessing:
- Cleansed the dataset to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers appropriately.
- Standardized and formatted data for analysis.

#### Data Analysis:
- Employed advanced SQL queries to explore the dataset comprehensively.
- Extracted key insights and patterns to gain a deeper understanding of the data.
- Visualized findings using appropriate techniques to facilitate interpretation.

#### Dataset Source:
